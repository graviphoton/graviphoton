<p class="lead">This is the Graviphoton interface prototype. It aims at showing off how backbone marionette gets used alongside twitter bootstrap to create an app that is pleasing for the developer as well as the user.</p>
<p>So far everything seems to work out. I'm especially glad that bootstrap and backbone seem to like each other. I also stumbed upon font-awesome again and decided to start using that instead of a sprite sheet. So far this uses the following components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>underscore.js</li>
  <li>backbone.js</li>
  <li>backbone.marionette</li>
  <li>twitter-bootstrap</li>
  <li>font-awesome</li>
  <li>backgrid.js</li>
</ul>
<p>You might look at the demos.</p>

  <li><a href="#grid/entity_country">Country Grid</a></li>
</ul>
